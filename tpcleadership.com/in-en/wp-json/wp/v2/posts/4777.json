Why does this team exist? What was it achieving? How does it serve the bigger purpose of the company\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In this episode, Tom Van Dyck is in conversation with Rob Shaw, Leading in Operations Programme Manager at BP.\u00a0 They discuss adapting to the changing business and social environment, the trust equation, challenges and paradoxes of safety &#8211; from physical safety in the workplace to psychological safety, to tight-knit teams &#8211; and how it all can lead to winning an award.<\/p>\n<h3>On building culture of care:<\/h3>\n<p>\uf0b7<span class=\"OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none\">\u201c..I think the key to that is coaching a culture of care where people feel really, really cared for, that they are valued for who they are, that they recognize that their leader cares for them and that the rest of the team care for each other \u2026\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>On trust and self-orientation:<\/h3>\n<p>\uf0b7 \u201cSo, it&#8217;s trust is equal to credibility, plus reliability plus intimacy, all over self-orientation, which means sort of the biggest factor in building trust or destroying trust is really about self-orientation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\uf0b7 \u201c\u2026when you&#8217;re building psychological safety, it&#8217;s really clear to the person or the team, that you&#8217;re building that psychological safety with that it&#8217;s all about them.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Listening to the quietest voice:<\/h3>\n<p>\u201c\u2026that people are doing the right thing that people are feeling like they can ask questions, or one of the things we talk about a lot in BP is listening to the quietest voice in the room.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\uf0b7 \u201cSo that person that may not be naturally vocal, not naturally going to speak up, pulling them into the conversation or how having a one-to-one conversation with them and hearing what&#8217;s on their mind. Because often it&#8217;s those people that have either got really good ideas, or spotted things that other people haven&#8217;t,\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Help but don&#8217;t solve &#8211; chain of trust<\/h3>\n<p>\uf0b7 \u201cAs you&#8217;ve got that chain of trust and you start to hear problems and people talking about problems, and you&#8217;ve demonstrated you&#8217;re listening to them, you&#8217;ve got to help them solve their problems.\u201c<\/p>\n<p>\uf0b7 \u201cIt&#8217;s important that you help them solve the problems rather than necessarily you go away and solve the problems for them \u201c<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201c\u2026 I think for me when you&#8217;ve got a team, first of all, you have to have a very, very clear purpose to the team.
